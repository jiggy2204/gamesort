# gamesort

This is for the Thinkful API Capstone. 

**Technical Requirements**

Implementation details are left entirely up to you, but at a minimum your app must meet the following requirements:

- Use Fetch to asynchronously load data from one or more APIs
- Use jQuery's DOM traversal and manipulation functionality to display the data from the API to the user in an interesting way
- Use jQuery's event listening capabilities to respond to user actions

**Summary**

This is a simple app that allows the user to search for a title, review what systems it is available on, and then a link to go to a store to buy the title.
